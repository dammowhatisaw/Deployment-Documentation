Definition: Git tags are references to specific points in Git history, usually used to mark release points or stable versions of a project. Unlike branches, tags are static and do not move with new commits.
Difference from Branches: While both tags and branches are references in Git, branches are dynamic and meant to track ongoing development, allowing new commits to be added. Tags, on the other hand, are fixed references to specific commits and are typically used to mark releases or significant points in the project's history.
Managing and Tracking Deployments with Git Tags:

Release Versioning: Tags are often used to version releases, making it easy to track and manage different versions of the codebase.
Stable References: Tags provide stable references to specific commits, ensuring that the code deployed for a release is consistent and reliable.
Rollback Capability: In case of issues, tags facilitate easy rollback to a known and stable state by checking out the code associated with a specific tag.
Using Git Tags for Stable Deployments:

Release Tags: Tag specific commits that are ready for deployment with a version number or release name.
Deployment Branch: Create a deployment branch from the tagged commit to isolate deployment-related changes.
Testing: Test the deployment branch in a staging environment to catch any potential issues.
Approval: Once testing is successful, promote the deployment branch to production, using the associated tag as a reference.
Ensuring Production Stability:

Tagging Milestones: Tag significant milestones in the project, not just releases, to have stable points to refer to if needed.
Communication: Maintain open communication within the team regarding ongoing work and potential impacts on the production environment.
Regular Integrations: Encourage regular integration of changes into a shared development branch to identify and resolve conflicts early.
Automated Testing: Implement automated testing in your CI/CD pipeline to catch integration issues before they reach the production environment.
Example Scenario:

Imagine your team is preparing for a major client release. You tag the commit with the finalized features and bug fixes as "v1.0.0."
A deployment branch "deploy-v1.0.0" is created from this tag.
Automated tests are run on the deployment branch in a staging environment.
The team verifies that the deployment branch works as expected in staging.
The code from "deploy-v1.0.0" is deployed to the client's production environment, providing a stable and controlled release.
By following this strategy, you ensure that Git tags play a pivotal role in marking stable points for deployment, versioning releases, and providing a reliable reference for both testing and production.
